**Epic Name:** EPIC: PAP-E09 - Non-Functional: Basic Styling, UI/UX & Deployment (MVP)

**1. Epic Summary / Goal:**
   * To ensure the PAP Web App MVP has a clean, consistent, and usable interface, is reasonably responsive for typical desktop and mobile viewing, and is successfully deployed to a hosting platform (Vercel) with basic CI/CD established.

**2. Business Value / User Benefit (The "Why"):**
   * A usable and aesthetically pleasing interface enhances the user experience, making the tool more enjoyable and effective to use.
   * Basic responsiveness ensures accessibility across common devices.
   * Successful deployment makes the application available for use and sets the stage for future iterations and feedback.
   * Establishes foundational project setup for styling, UI components, and deployment automation.

**3. Scope:**
   * **In Scope (Key Deliverables/Features):**
        * Initial Next.js project setup with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui (as per original PAP-TASK-001 from previous planning, now re-contextualized as part of this broader NFR epic's execution stories).
        * Development of a simple, consistent global layout component for the application.
        * Ensuring basic navigation is clear and intuitive.
        * Basic responsiveness for major desktop browsers and common mobile device widths (readability and usability).
        * Setting up the project on Vercel for CI/CD, linking to the Git repository.
        * Configuring Vercel build settings for the Next.js application.
        * Managing environment variables (especially Supabase keys) securely in Vercel.
   * **Out of Scope (For this Epic/MVP Release):**
        * Advanced or complex UI animations and transitions.
        * Exhaustive testing across all possible devices and browsers (focus on common ones).
        * Pixel-perfect design implementation if detailed mockups are not provided; focus on good Shadcn/ui defaults and clean presentation.
        * Performance optimization beyond reasonable defaults.
        * Comprehensive accessibility (a11y) audit and fixes (basic good practices applied).
        * Offline support or PWA features.

**4. Key Features / User Stories (Derived from original PAP tasks PAP-39 to PAP-42, and referencing initial setup tasks):**
   * `PAP-STORY-042`: As a developer, I need to initialize the Next.js project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript and integrate Tailwind CSS for styling, so the project has a modern technical foundation.
     * (Derived from PAP-39, related to PAP-TASK-001)
   * `PAP-STORY-043`: As a developer, I need to initialize Shadcn/ui in the project, so I can leverage its pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI components.
     * (Derived from PAP-39, related to PAP-TASK-001)
   * `PAP-STORY-044`: As a user, I want the application to have a consistent global layout and clear navigation, so I can easily find my way around the different modules.
     * (Derived from PAP-40)
   * `PAP-STORY-045`: As a user, I want the application to be reasonably responsive, so I can view and use it effectively on my desktop browser and on my mobile phone (primarily for readability and basic interaction).
     * (Derived from PAP-41)
   * `PAP-STORY-046`: As a developer, I need to set up the PAP Web App project on Vercel, linking it to the Git repository, so that it can be automatically built and deployed.
     * (Derived from PAP-42, related to PAP-TASK-003)
   * `PAP-STORY-047`: As a developer, I need to configure Vercel build settings and manage environment variables (like Supabase API keys) securely for successful deployments.
     * (Derived from PAP-42, related to PAP-TASK-003)

**5. Acceptance Criteria (High-Level for Epic):**
   * The Next.js project is successfully initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui.
   * A global layout component provides consistent structure across pages.
   * Navigation between modules is functional and easy to understand.
   * The application is usable on common desktop screen sizes and readable on common mobile screen sizes.
   * The application successfully deploys to Vercel from the main branch of the Git repository.
   * Environment variables are correctly configured in Vercel, allowing the deployed app to connect to Supabase.

**6. Dependencies:**
   * Git repository created for the project.
   * Vercel account available.
   * Supabase project created (for environment variables).
   * Completion or significant progress on other epics, as this epic ensures their deployability and usability.

**7. Metrics for Success (Optional for Epic, but good for focus):**
   * Successful, automated deployments to Vercel on git push to main branch.
   * User (self) can access and use the deployed application from a Vercel URL.
   * Visual consistency is maintained across different modules.

**8. Notes / Assumptions:**
   * This epic's stories, particularly those related to initial project setup (Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn) and Vercel deployment, are foundational and may have been partially addressed by earlier specific task documents (PAP-TASK-001, PAP-TASK-003). They are reiterated here to ensure all NFR aspects are covered under a dedicated epic.
   * "Basic responsiveness" means ensuring content flows and is readable, not necessarily a fully optimized mobile-first design for every intricate feature in MVP.
   * The UI theme will be simple and clean, relying heavily on Shadcn/ui defaults with minimal custom styling for MVP.
