**Epic Name:** EPIC: PAP-E01 - User Authentication & Basic Account Setup (MVP)

**1. Epic Summary / Goal:**
   * To establish a secure and functional user authentication system for the PAP Web App, enabling users to register, log in, manage their passwords, and access their personal accounts. This is foundational for all personalized features of the application.

**2. Business Value / User Benefit (The "Why"):**
   * Provides secure access to the user's personal PAP data, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
   * Enables a personalized experience by associating data and progress with a specific user.
   * Solves the meta-user's need to have a private, dedicated space for their self-actualization work.

**3. Scope:**
   * **In Scope (Key Deliverables/Features):**
        * User registration using email and password (Supabase Auth).
        * User login and logout functionality (Supabase Auth).
        * Secure password hashing and storage (handled by Supabase).
        * Basic password reset/"Forgot Password" flow (Supabase Auth).
        * Initialization of Supabase client within the Next.js application.
        * Configuration of basic Supabase Auth settings.
        * Creation of UI components (Shadcn/ui + Tailwind) for Sign Up, Login, and a simple Profile display area.
        * Implementation of basic Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to ensure users can only access their own data.
   * **Out of Scope (For this Epic/MVP Release):**
        * Social logins (e.g., Google, GitHub).
        * Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
        * Advanced profile customization (e.g., avatars, detailed bio).
        * Email verification emails (can be a fast-follow if deemed critical for MVP, but for a solo user, initial MVP might defer).
        * Role-based access control beyond basic user data isolation.

**4. Key Features / User Stories (Derived from original PAP tasks PAP-1 to PAP-7):**
   * `PAP-STORY-001`: As a new user, I want to be able to register for an account using my email and a secure password so that I can begin using the PAP Web App.
     * (Derived from PAP-1, PAP-4)
   * `PAP-STORY-002`: As a registered user, I want to be able to log in to my account using my email and password so that I can access my personalized PAP data and features.
     * (Derived from PAP-5)
   * `PAP-STORY-003`: As an authenticated user, I want to be able to log out of my account so that I can ensure my session is ended securely.
     * (Derived from PAP-5)
   * `PAP-STORY-004`: As a user who has forgotten my password, I want to be able to securely reset my password so that I can regain access to my account.
     * (Derived from PAP-6)
   * `PAP-STORY-005`: As an authenticated user, I want to see a simple profile display area so I know I am logged in and can access basic account actions.
     * (Derived from PAP-3)
   * `PAP-STORY-006`: As a developer, I need the Supabase client library to be integrated into the Next.js application and configured with the appropriate environment variables (URL and anon key) so that the application can communicate with Supabase services.
     * (Derived from PAP-2)
   * `PAP-STORY-007`: As a developer, I need basic Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented on Supabase tables (initially for user-specific data) to ensure that users can only access and modify their own information.
     * (Derived from PAP-7)
   * `PAP-STORY-008`: As a developer, I need the Supabase project to be initialized and basic Auth settings (like email/password provider) configured in the Supabase dashboard.
     * (Derived from PAP-1)

**5. Acceptance Criteria (High-Level for Epic):**
   * A new user can successfully create an account and log in.
   * An existing user can successfully log in and log out.
   * A user can successfully complete the password reset flow.
   * Basic UI for authentication (sign-up, login, profile stub) is functional and presentable.
   * Supabase client is correctly initialized and communicating with the backend.
   * Basic RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access between users (testable once data-creating features are in).

**6. Dependencies:**
   * Supabase project created and accessible.
   * Next.js project initialized (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui as per PAP-TASK-001).
   * Environment variables for Supabase (URL, Anon Key) are configured for the Next.js application.

**7. Metrics for Success (Optional for Epic, but good for focus):**
   * User (self) can successfully register and log in without errors.
   * All authentication-related UI components are functional and meet basic usability standards.

**8. Notes / Assumptions:**
   * This epic focuses on the core email/password authentication flow provided by Supabase Auth.
   * For the MVP, the primary user is the developer (meta-user); therefore, flows are optimized for single-user experience initially, but built with multi-user capability in mind for Supabase RLS.
   * Error handling for auth forms will be basic but clear for the MVP.
