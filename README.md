# PAP Web App - MVP (Principled Actualization Protocol)

This project outlines the development of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Principled Actualization Protocol (PAP) Web App.
The MVP focuses on enabling a single user to manage their personal actualization journey through various integrated modules.

## Project Organization: Epics for MVP v1.0 Release

The work for the PAP Web App MVP (v1.0 Release) is organized into the following 9 core Epics. Each Epic represents a major functional area and will contain a set of detailed User Stories and tasks. Full definitions for each Epic, including their scope and constituent stories, will be located in the `docs/epics/` directory.
